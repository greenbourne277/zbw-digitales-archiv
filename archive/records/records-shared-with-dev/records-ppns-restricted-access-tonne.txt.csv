1657166880	m	2014	EMU and the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy : a suggested interpretation				Landmann, Oliver		urn:nbn:de:bsz:25-freidok-136283|10.6094/UNIFR/13628		Freiburg : Institut für Allgemeine Wirtschaftsforschung, Universität Freiburg	eng		Revised, August 2014	Discussion paper series / University of Freiburg, Department of International Economic Policy	000000000			http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:25-freidok-136283	
814437907	m	2014	What determines access to piped water in rural areas? : evidence from small-scale supply systems in rural Brazil				Barde, Julia Alexa		10419/147444		Freiburg : Univ., Dep. of International Economic Policy	eng			Discussion paper series / University of Freiburg, Department of International Economic Policy	000000000			http://www.vwl.uni-freiburg.de/iwipol/discussion_papers/DP30_Barde_What_Determines_Access_to.pdf	This paper compares the increases in access rates to piped water in rural Brazil by localized water supply systems under two different management models. It finds that small-scale supply systems operated and maintained by user associations lead to significantly higher increases in access rates than comparable systems implemented and operated by local governments. Additional results point towards higher accountability as the reason for better performance. This paper is the first to evaluate the success of community-based water supply projects in rural areas by comparing them to non-participatory projects and is based on a valid econometric identification strategy. As service delivery is decentralized in Brazil, the results also contribute to the discussion of the merits and risks of decentralized water supply. In order to overcome the endogeneity problem, I use a difference-in-difference estimator in combination with a kernel matching approach. Treatment effects are robust to various specification changes;  tests show no structural differences between treatment and control groups.

We endogenize the drift rate of real option by connecting it to the state of the economy. Thereby, we extend the analysis of the optimal capital accumulation policy in the firm sector and show the different implications of idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainty on growth dynamics.

The panel data on corruption allow to control for unobserved heterogeneity with fixed effects estimation. We address the problem of endogeneity by introducing novel instrumental variables for corruption: the presence of free press and violations of journalists' rights. Our main result is the strong negative effect of corruption on aggregate investment in fixed capital. Disaggregating investment by ownership, we find that corruption decreases private investment, but not investment made by state-owned companies. The effect is larger for companies with foreign ownership. We also observe a strong negative relationship between regional import of capital goods and corruption.

The analysis, which is based on a systematic disaggregation of trade based on global production sharing into components and final assembly, suggests that the Sino-US trade gap is a structural phenomenon driven by the pivotal role played by China within East Asia cantered production networks. The global competitiveness of US MNEs depends on their ability to use China as the production base for supplying the rest of the world, and China is now an important supplier of components used in US manufacturing. Given this intricate interdependence between the two economies within global production networks, attempt to impose punitive tariffs on China is bound to face formidable opposition from business interests in the United States. Even if the protectionist threat becomes a reality, the impact may not be as damaging as commonly thought because global production sharing has considerably weakened the link between relative prices and trade flows."

We find economic, environmental, and cultural factors as well as the presence of Muslims to determine voting behavior. Approval rates for the bill rise with unemployment and decrease with education, income, and the attractiveness of the location. Approval is higher in rural areas, in municipalities with a higher share of men, and in the Italian and German speaking parts of Switzerland. It is higher in municipalities with a higher share of Muslims, which strongly supports the ""religious threat"" hypothesis. We compare the voting behavior in the minaret referendum with the referendum ""for democratic naturalizations"", held in 2008, in order to disentangle determinants of Islamophobia from those of xenophobia. We show that our results are robust to the estimation with ecological inference."
1013239334	m	2018	To the ones in need or the ones you need? : the political economy of central discretionary grants ; empirical evidence from Indonesia				Gonschorek, Gerrit J.	Schulze, Günther G.|Sjahrir Putra, Bambang Suharnoko Firmansyah	10419/175868		Freiburg, Germany : Department of International Economic Policy, Institute for Economic Research, University of Freiburg	eng			Discussion paper series / University of Freiburg, Department of International Economic Policy	000000000			http://www.vwl-iwipol.uni-freiburg.de/iwipol/REPEC/fre/wpaper/DP36_To_The_Ones_In_Need_Or_The_Ones_You_Need.pdf	We analyze the allocation of discretionary grants from the central government to local governments in Indonesia. Using OLS and Fixed Effects models on an unbalanced panel data set for more than 400 Indonesian districts covering the period 2005-2013, we investigate whether the allocation of the grants is determined by the need of a district, by political alignment of the central government with the local district heads, or by reelection motives of the incumbent president. We find that grant allocations are not determined by need characteristics and that political considerations matter significantly. Districts with low support for the president received significantly more than the core supporting districts, especially in the year of national elections. This effect is limited to the first term of the president. In the second term, after which reelection is impossible, political considerations were largely absent. This pattern is consistent with the view that the incumbent president considers discretionary grants as an instrument to increase reelection probabilities. Unlike the evidence for most countries, we find no effect for political party alignment with local district heads. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a number of other variables capturing competing motives.

By exploiting a British-driven institutional switch in part of China's customs stations in 1902, I find that counties that were more affected by the British customs institutions are also better developed today. Moreover, I show that the institutional switch was exogenous to the pre-colonial development, and I provide different estimation models to reveal a robust and causal relationship between good institutions and economic development.

Sozialwissenschaften	000000000			https://www.iubh-university.de/wp-content/uploads/DP_Sozialwiss_Schomers_2020_01-1.pdf	This study aims to examine the relationship between methods from qualitative empiric research and their practical relevance in certain fields of social work. Research object and example is the assistance planning for disabled people. This text will answer a number of questions: Why do we need qualitative empirical knowledge in the various fields of social work? Which qualitative empirical methods are relevant? What skill sets are necessary for the observer and interviewer? The example of the individual help planning (IHP) authorized and granted by the Landschaftsverband Rheinland (LVR) allows examination and discussion of two important methods: the interview and the participative observation. To write a professional individual help planning, which aims are operationalized, it is necessary to take three different steps: the first phase of exploring, the second phase of interviewing and the third phase of postprocessing or editing. Best practices for collecting robust empirical data under every day field conditions in social work are identified. One example is to define behavioral rules to mitigate negative effects of the behavior of the observer and interviewer on the results, or to codify positive effects.

Sozialwissenschaften	000000000			https://www.iubh-university.de/wp-content/uploads/DP_Sozialwissen_Bongartz_2020.pdf	It is difficult to reach scientific agreement on concepts and explanations of the phenomenon of terrorism. One reason may be the diversity of terrorist acts, another is certainly the imprecise and careless use of the term. The struggle for a conceptual framing of the phenomenon of terrorism and a precise definition remains; some terrorism researchers, such as Christopher Daase, even argue that the search for the semantic core of terrorism should be abandoned (Daase, 2011, p. 29). This must not lead to abandoning research into the nature of terrorism. Rather, it is time to expand the phenomenon conceptually, in order to then specify it again in its diversity. A first theoretical appeal is to focus less on the concept of terrorism and more on facets of politically motivated crime, including hate crimes.

Sozialwissenschaften	000000000			https://www.iubh-university.de/wp-content/uploads/DP_Sozial_Pitters_3_2020fin.pdf	A novel Covid-19 virus initially threatens the Chinese metropolis of Wu-Han and has been causing a global pandemic in 2020. In order to impede the spread of the virus and thus relieve the burden on the respective health care systems, governments around the world are being forced to impose unprecedented restrictions on social life. In addition to closing all forms of public life and cancelling all public events, the measures taken in Austria also include an initial restriction for the individual to stay at home. From an economic-psychological point of view, the decision to comply with these measures can be described as a social dilemma. The individual would profit from defection but at the expense of the general public. The Federal Government must therefore provide appropriate incentives to convince citizens to still comply either through trust or sanctions. Using the example of Austria, this article examines how the emergence of the crisis is first perceived, which communication strategies are used to motivate citizens to comply and why citizens sometimes react with supposedly irrational actions.

Sozialwissenschaften	000000000			https://www.iubh-university.de/wp-content/uploads/DP_Sozial_meyer_buschle_4_2020.pdf	The corona pandemic, but also contact restrictions and other hygiene measures have significantly changed the actions and routines of social work workers. The first trends from the quantitative study on the work situation in social work during the corona pandemic are now available. It is already becoming apparent: In addition to the concentration of work, employees perceive changed work alliances with the addressees as well as changed professional standards. Despite higher demands, however, social recognition remains low. At present it is still open what consequences the changes in occupational standards will have for professional action in social work in the future.

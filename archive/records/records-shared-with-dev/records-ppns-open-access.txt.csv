1698364504	m	2020	Using difference-in-differences to identify causal effects of COVID-19 policies				Goodman-Bacon, Andrew	Marcus, Jan	10419/218991		Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	C1|I18		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.789794.de/dp1870.pdf	Policymakers have implemented a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions to ﬁght the spread of COVID-19. Variation in policies across jurisdictions and over time strongly suggests a difference-in-differences (DD) research design to estimate causal effects of counter-COVID measures. We discuss threats to the validity of these DD designs and make recommendations about how researchers can avoid bias, interpret results accurately, and provide sound guidance to policymakers seeking to protect public health and facilitate an eventual economic recovery.
1699823235	m	2020	Structural vector autoregressive models with more shocks than variables identified via heteroskedasticity				Lütkepohl, Helmut		10419/218992		Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	C32		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.790068.de/dp1871.pdf	In conventional structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models it is assumed that there are at most as many structural shocks as there are variables in the model. It is pointed out that heteroskedasticity can be used to identify more shocks than variables. However, even if there is heteroskedasticity, the number of shocks that can be identiﬁed is limited. A number of results are provided that allow a researcher to assess how many shocks can be identiﬁed from speciﬁc forms of heteroskedasticity.
1699823316	m	2020	Active, or passive? : revisiting the role of fiscal policy in the great inflation				Ettmeier, Stephanie	Kriwoluzky, Alexander	10419/218993		Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	C11|C15|E63|E65		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.790071.de/dp1872.pdf	We reexamine whether pre-Volcker U.S. ﬁscal policy was active or passive. To do so, we estimate a DSGE model with monetary and ﬁscal policy interactions employing a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm (SMC) for posterior evaluation. Unlike existing studies, we do not have to treat each policy regime as distinct, separately estimated, models. Rather, SMC enables us to estimate the DSGE model over its entire parameter space. A differentiated perspective results: pre-Volcker macroeconomic dynamics were similarly driven by a passive monetary/passive ﬁscal policy regime and ﬁscal dominance. Fiscal policy actions, especially government spending, were critical in the pre-Volcker inﬂation build-up.
1699979197	m	2020	The macroeconomic effects of a European deposit (re-)insurance scheme				Clemens, Marius	Gebauer, Stefan|König, Tobias	10419/218994		Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	E61|F42|F45|G22|G28		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.790118.de/dp1873.pdf	While the ﬁrst two pillars of the European Banking Union have been implemented, a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) is still not in place. To facilitate its introduction, recent proposals argue in favor of a reinsurance scheme. In this paper, we use a regime-switching open-economy DSGE model with bank default and bank-government linkages to assess the relative efficiency of such a scheme. We find that reinsurance by both a national fiscal backstop and EDIS is efficient in stabilizing the macro economy, even though welfare gains are slightly larger with EDIS and debt-to-GDP ratios rise under the fiscal reinsurance. We demonstrate that risk-weighted contributions to EDIS are welfare-beneficial for depositors and discuss trade-offs policy makers face during the implementation of EDIS. In a counterfactual exercise, we find that EDIS would have stabilized economic activity in Germany and the rest of the euro area just as well as a fiscal backing of insured deposits during the financial crisis. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been lower with EDIS.
1702655466	m	2020	Distributional effects of the COVID-19 lockdown				Clemens, Marius	Heinemann, Maik			Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	D31|E21|E62|I14		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.791516.de/dp1874.pdf	A two-sector incomplete markets model with heterogeneous agents can be used to study the distributional effects of the COVID-19 lockdown. While negative aggregate welfare effects of the lockdown are unavoidable, the size of aggregate welfare effects as well as the distribution of the welfare effects across agents turn out to depend on the specific economic environment of the affected economy as well as the response of the government to the shock. We use the model to simulate the lockdown effects based on a calibration to German data. First, we find that without state aid and limited access to international financial markets especially poor household suffer large welfare losses, while wealthy house- hold could even benefit from the lockdown. Second, a state aid program reduces large parts of the welfare losses of workers across all income groups in the affected sectors by forcing loss sharing with agents working in the non-affected sector. However, wealthy households no matter in which sector still benefit more than the average household. Third, access to international financial markets is key to shift relative welfare gains from superrich to poorer households in both sectors. Once the country is able to borrow internationally, the benefit for superrich diminishes. Our results implicate that countries with rather limited access to financial markets and less stable government budget positions will suffer higher welfare losses and increases in inequality.
1702663175	m	2020	The impact of carbon disclosure mandates on emissions and financial operating performance				Downar, Benedikt	Ernstberger, Jürgen|Reichelstein, Stefan|Schwenen, Sebastian|Zaklan, Aleksandar			Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	Q28|Q40|M41|M48	updated version of DP 1795	Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.791134.de/dp1875.pdf	We examine whether a disclosure mandate for greenhouse gas emissions creates stakeholder pressure for firms to subsequently reduce their emissions. For UK-incorporated listed firms such a mandate was adopted in 2013. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that firms affected by the mandate reduced their emissions - depending on the specification - by an incremental 14-18% relative to a control group. This reduction was accompanied by an average 9% increase in production costs. At the same time, the treated firms were able to increase their sales by an almost compensating amount. Taken together, our findings provide no indication that the disclosure requirement led to a significant deterioration in the financial operating performance of the treated firms, despite the significant carbon footprint reduction following the disclosure mandate.
1702666794	m	2020	Heteroskedastic proxy vector autoregressions				Lütkepohl, Helmut	Schlaak, Thore			Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	C32	This version: June 10, 2020	Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.791829.de/dp1876.pdf	In proxy vector autoregressive models, the structural shocks of interest are identified by an instrument. Although heteroskedasticity is occasionally allowed for, it is typically taken for granted that the impact effects of the structural shocks are time-invariant despite the change in their variances. We develop a test for this implicit assumption and present evidence that the assumption of time-invariant impact effects may be violated in previously used empirical models.
1702675955	m	2020	Make sure the kids are ok : indirect effects of ground-level ozone on well-being				Rechlitz, Julia	Sarmiento, Luis|Zaklan, Aleksandar			Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	Q53|I31|I18|J22		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.791856.de/dp1877.pdf	This paper uses a panel of German individuals and highly granular pollution data to test if air pollution affects adults' well-being indirectly through the health of their children. Results show that ozone decreases the well-being of individuals with children while not affecting persons without kids. We confirm the same effect for fine particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. Concerning the mechanism, we find that above-median earners drive this effect and that ozone causes losses in workdays to care for a sick child, providing evidence on the children's health channel to adults' welfare losses.
1702683745	m	2020	Waiting for my sentence : air pollution and the productivity of court rulings				Sarmiento, Luis				Berlin : DIW Berlin, German Institute for Economic Research	eng	C23|J24|Q53		Discussion papers / Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung	(DE-627)37244587X|(DE-576)281234957|(DE-600)2125067-4			https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.792495.de/dp1878.pdf	I assert that air pollution from nitrogen oxides affects the productivity of employees in Mexican court hearings. This is the ﬁrst article analyzing this connection and the ﬁrst to disentangle work-breaks from the productivity of white-collar workers. I merge hourly pollution with granular hearing data under the assumption that the length of the hearing approximates productivity and identify causality from panel and instrumental variable techniques. Results show a loss of 3.83 workdays during the sample period due to the productivity shock stemming from comparing exposure at the hours with the highest and lowest concentration of nitrogen oxides in the data-set.
1067262644	b	2019	Transitions between informal and formal employment : results from a worker survey in Bangladesh				Gutierrez, Italo A.	Kumar, Krishna B.|Mahmud, Minhaj Uddin|Munshi, Farzana|Nataraj, Shanthi	10.1186/s40176-019-0141-2|10419/222171	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	J32|J46|J62				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://izajodm.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40176-019-0141-2	We study transitions between different types of formal and informal employment using retrospective job histories from a new survey in Bangladesh. Workers transitioning between jobs are most likely to remain in the same type of employment, although there is still substantial churn across employment types. Private wage employees have higher probability of transitioning to a new job, and changes in earnings and benefits suggest evidence of upward mobility. Nevertheless, there is also non-trivial risk of downward mobility, especially for those transitioning into casual employment, which has the lowest level of earnings and benefits and the highest levels of exposure to workplace hazards and violence. Overall, the informal sector appears to include subpopulations consistent with both the traditional view that it is a segmented portion of the labor market with few prospects of upward mobility, and with the alternative view that it is a dynamic, entrepreneurial alternative to wage employment.
1067257276	b	2019	The effectiveness and effects of alcohol regulation : evidence from India				Luca, Dara Lee	Owens, Emily|Sharma, Gunjan	10.1186/s40176-018-0139-1|10419/197486	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	I18|K42|J12				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://izajodm.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40176-018-0139-1	We provide quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of alcohol regulation on alcohol consumption and associated public health outcomes using detailed individual level and aggregate data from India, where state-level laws regulating the minimum legal drinking age generate substantial variation in the availability of commercially produced alcohol across people of different ages. We find that despite significant law evasion, men who are legally allowed to drink are substantially more likely to consume alcohol. Further, men who are legally allowed to drink are significantly more likely to commit violence against their partners, suggesting a causal channel between alcohol consumption and domestic violence. These results are robust to the exclusion of states with prohibition, implying that they are driven by differences in MLDA. We also examine the effects of alcohol regulation on other public health outcomes. Consistent with the existing literature, we find evidence that smoking and drinking are complements. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that stricter alcohol control is associated with lower rates of motor vehicle accidents and crimes against women, but not other forms of crime.
1067262792	b	2019	Considering the benefits of hosting refugees : evidence of refugee camps influencing local labour market activity and economic welfare in Rwanda				Loschmann, Craig	Bilgili, Özge|Siegel, Melissa	10.1186/s40176-018-0138-2|10419/222172	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	O12|F22|R23|J24|I31|J60				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://izajodm.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40176-018-0138-2	This paper examines the influence of Congolese refugees on host communities in Rwanda, with a focus on labour market activity and economic welfare. The analysis takes advantage of newly collected survey data from three refugee camps and their surrounding areas to compare individuals and households within communities at various distances from, and therefore exposure to, the refugee population. We find evidence that residing close to a refugee camp makes it more likely that an individual is engaged in wage employment in comparison to farming or livestock production, representing a shift away from subsistence farming activities. In addition, there is evidence that females living nearby a camp have a higher occurrence of self-employment in business both as a primary and secondary activity, highlighting a notable gender-specific dynamic. Likewise, living in close proximity to a camp is associated with greater household asset ownership, benefiting both male- and female-headed households similarly, whereas no relationship is found in regard to ones’ subjective perception of their household’s economic situation. These generally encouraging results illustrate that refugees need not be a burden to their host societies, and their presence results in direct and indirect benefits.
1676958428	b	2019	Discrimination in a search and matching model with self-employment				Lain, Jonathan		10.1186/s40176-019-0140-3|10419/222179	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	J46|J60|J71				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://izajodm.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40176-019-0140-3	In many urban African labour markets, women outnumber men in self-employment, even though gender earnings gaps are larger for the self-employed than the wage-employed. In this paper, we suggest an explanation for this pattern using a search and matching model that allows for individual heterogeneity and participation in both self- and wage-employment as well as discrimination against women in the wage sector. We show that discrimination in wage-employment can generate gender earnings gaps across all sectors of the economy, even if the underlying ability distributions for women and men are identical. This result arises because discrimination creates extra frictions for women, making it harder for them to select occupations according to their comparative advantage. Moreover, the earnings gaps that arise turn out to be larger for the self-employed, even though it is not the self-employment sector that is characterised by discrimination. Policy makers may therefore need to target the wage sector in order to address gender inequality for the self-employed.
1676956794	b	2019	Migration, cultural identity and diasporas : an identity economics approach				Prinz, Aloys	Siegel, Melissa	10.2478/izajodm-2019-0001|10419/222173	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	D91|I31|J15|J61				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/izajodm/10/1/article-20190001.xml	Besides effects on economic well-being, migration of people with distant cultural backgrounds may also have large effects on people’s cultural identity. In this paper, the identity economics of Akerlof and Kranton (2000) is applied to migration. Accordingly, it is assumed that the utility of both the immigrants and the native population encompasses economic well-being and cultural identity. The migration effect on cultural identity depends, among others, on the distance between cultures. In a simple immigration game it is shown that immigrants may prefer to live rather in diaspora communities than to integrate into the host countries’ culture. This subgame-perfect equilibrium choice of immigrants seems the more likely the greater the cultural distance between their country of origin and the destination country is. Among the available policy instruments, restrictions on the freedom of movement and settlement of immigrants may be the most effective way to prevent the setup of large diaspora communities. For young immigrants and later generations of immigrants, integration via compulsory schooling is the most important policy. In general, cultural, religious and social institutions may support integration.
1676957146	b	2019	Asymmetric information and the discount on foreign-acquired degrees in Canada				Aydede, Yigit	Dar, Atul A.	10.2478/izajodm-2019-0002|10419/222174	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	J6|J15|J61				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/izajodm/10/1/article-20190002.xml	A growing wage gap between immigrant and native-born workers is well documented and is a fundamental policy issue in Canada. It is quite possible that wage differences, commonly attributed to the lower quality of foreign credentials or the deficiency in the accreditation of these credentials, merely reflect lower wage offers that immigrant workers receive due to risk aversion among local firms facing an elevated degree of asymmetric information. Using the 2006 and 2011 population censuses, this paper empirically investigates the effects of wage bargaining in labor markets on the wage gap between foreign- and Canadian-educated workers. Our results imply that a significant part of the wage gap between foreign-educated and Canadian-educated immigrant (and native-born) workers is not driven by the employers’ risk aversion but by differences in human capital endowments and occupational matching quality.
1676957383	b	2019	Substitution between immigrant and native farmworkers in the United States : does legal status matter?				Wei, Xuan	Onel, Gulcan|Guan, Zhengfei|Roka, Fritz M.	10.2478/izajodm-2019-0007|10419/222175	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	J20|J43|J61				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/izajodm/10/1/article-20190007.xml	The policy debate surrounding the employment of immigrant workers in U.S. agriculture centers around the extent to which immigrant farmworkers adversely affect the economic opportunities of native farmworkers. To help answer this question, we propose a three-layer nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) framework to investigate the substitutability among heterogeneous farmworker groups based on age, skill, and legal status utilizing National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) data from 1989 through 2012. We use farmwork experience and type of task performed as alternative proxies for skill to disentangle the substitution effect between U.S. citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrant farmworkers. Results show that substitutability between the three legal status groups is small; neither authorized nor unauthorized immigrant farmworkers have a significant impact on the employment of native farmworkers.
1676957685	b	2019	Fragmenting the family? : the complexity of household migration strategies in post-apartheid South Africa				Hall, Katharine	Posel, Dorrit	10.2478/izajodm-2019-0004|10419/222176	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/		eng	O15|J13				IZA Journal of development and migration	(DE-627)888074735|(DE-600)2895178-5|(DE-576)488947375	https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/izajodm/10/2/article-20190004.xml	The disruption of family life is one of the important legacies of South Africa’s colonial and apartheid history. Families were undermined by deliberate strategies implemented through the pass laws, forced removals, urban housing policy, and the creation of homelands. Despite the removal of legal restrictions on permanent urban settlement and family co-residence for Africans, patterns of internal and oscillating labor migration have endured, dual or stretched households continue to link urban and rural nodes, children have remained less urbanized than adults, and many grow up without coresident parents. Although children are clearly affected by adult labor migration, they have tended to be ignored in the migration discourse. In this study, we add to the literature by showing how a child lens advances our understanding of the complexities of household arrangements and migration processes for families. In a mixed-methods study, we use nationally representative panel data to describe persistence, and also change, in migration patterns in South Africa when viewed from the perspective of children. We then draw on a detailed case study to explore what factors constrain or permit families to migrate together, or children to join adults at migration destination areas.

Diasporas are shown to contribute to the economic and cultural integration of source (i.e., developing) countries into the global economy. I first review the effect of diaspora networks on core globalization outcomes such as trade, foreign investments, and the diffusion of knowledge and technology across borders. I then turn to the cultural and political sway of the diaspora, investigating the impact of emigration on the formation of political attitudes, fertility behavior, and other aspects of culture in the home country.

Recently, due in no small part to the availability of rich microdata, more attention has been paid to the effects of migration on the lives of family members left behind. This paper examines how the temporary migration of parents for work affects the health outcomes of children left behind using the longitudinal data obtained from the Indonesia Family Life Survey. The anthropometric measure of the child health used, height-for-age, serves as a proxy for stunting. The evidence suggests that whether parental migration is beneficial or deleterious to the child health depends on which parent moved. In particular, migration of the mother has an adverse effect on the child’s height-for-age, reducing height-for-age Z-score by 0.5 standard deviations. This effect is not seen on the migration of the father.

Accordingly, education can make a lifelong difference in individuals' lives. It is proved that, on average, there is a positive relationship between each additional year of schooling and the income of an individual. The main objective of this paper is to estimate the demand and supply functions for schooling in Egypt using the data of the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey 2012. It is estimated that the private rate of return to education is 4.5%. Moreover, the rate of return to the number of years of experience is 2.6%, i.e. each additional year of experience will increase the earnings of an individual by 2.6% on average. It is concluded that individuals from poor families have an increased likelihood of receiving financial aid, which decreases their discounting rate of interest.

The study employed six unbundled governance indicators from the World Bank, World Governance Indicators and constructed three bundled governance indicators using the Principal Component Analysis. The Driscoll and Kraay Fixed Effects model which accounts for serial correlation, groupwise heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence were employed with empirical results revealing that all the indicators of governance positively and significantly influence domestic investment in Africa, except for government effectiveness which happens to be insignificant. Also, Voice/Accountability and the Control of Corruption exert more influence on domestic investment as indicated by their coefficient values. Furthermore, economic growth is also an important factor in explaining domestic investment in Africa. Policy recommendations are discussed.

In this article, we study the impact of social capital on banking performance focusing on profitability in the European Union for period 2008-2016. Social capital indicators are applied in the model are ""trust in others"" and ""fair behavior of others"". We expect more profitable banks in societies with higher levels of social capital. According to the type of data, we apply GMM estimator to do more efficient estimations. We use auxiliary variables such as bank asset, capital adequacy, real interest rate, the cost to income ratio as micro variables, GDP and inflation are employed as macros. Our estimations point at a rejection of the main hypothesis. Opportunistic behavior and less social trust result in more profits for European countries. We justify the results in two ways. First, due to the 2008 financial crisis, trust in all institutions has decreased in European countries. The second reason concerns countries with low levels of social capital. The decrease of trust for the banking system is lower than for other institutions. Therefore, that sector may benefit is such circumstances."

Residents form their attitude towards tourism through a cost-benefit analysis based on their perception of tourism impacts. The objective of this paper is to analyse the relationship between the perception of the different types of impacts, the general attitude toward tourism and various types of tourism offer: sport tourism, maritime tourism, nature tourism and sun and beach tourism. The analysis of the data was performed using Partial Least Squares on a sample of 420 residents of the Maldonado-Punta del Este conurbation, interviewed in 2016. The strongest causal relationship is between general attitude and acceptance of sun and beach tourism, the traditional offer in the region. The main conclusion is that a more favourable attitude to tourism does not imply greater support for any type of tourism. It is not possible to generalize the support to tourism to any tourism project, and tourist destinations managers must take it into account.

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was designed for the evaluation index improvement for research equipment relocation, and the pairwise comparison scale was set up based on the importance of each evaluation criterion. The consistency rate (CR) was measured, and it was confirmed that the decision- making was reasonable. The improvement of the evaluation index was necessary for the objective and fair relocation of research equipment. Therefore, the evaluation index for the relocation of research equipment was designed for an objective and fair evaluation. It is hoped that the study findings will be very useful and will contribute greatly to the professors, researchers, and policymakers involved in science and technology policymaking and R&D.

The specific focus is on the relationship between increased capital requirements and the subsequent change in both supply and the price of bank credit. This study employs a twofold data consisting of a panel of Finnish unlisted savings and cooperative banks' key figures over the period 2002-2018 and a representative survey conducted with personnel of Finnish institutions. In addition to the consistent finding in regards to the effect of bank profitability as well as fairly consistent findings in regards to the effect of bank size and GDP growth, the key finding suggests a slight decrease in loan supply under the CRD IV.

The results show that corporate tax rate has a significantly negative effect on economic growth. Moreover, the recent financial crisis has had a significant effect on the endogenous interaction between corporate tax rate and economic growth. According to Granger causality test, there is only one-way causality from corporate tax rate to economic growth during the non-crisis period. Interestingly, there are not any causal relationships between corporate tax rate and economic growth during the crisis period. The results show that the recent crisis has had a significant effect on the endogenous interaction between corporate tax rate and economic growth.

We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. Our findings reveal the following: Firstly, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while the majority of our governance determinants of Gross FDI are significant, they are overwhelmingly insignificant for Net FDI. Secondly, the significance of the governance dynamics in increasing order of magnitude are general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. Thirdly, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance. The results indicate that the simultaneous implementation of the various components of governance clarifies a country's attractiveness for FDI location. Policy implications are discussed with particular emphasis on the timing of FDI and its targeting.

However, from a technical and management point of view, it would be preferable to adopt a single tax rate as it reduces distortions and facilitates tax compliance and management. This research seeks to analyse the benefits and disadvantages of adopting a single VAT as a means of simplifying the European VAT model. It takes Portugal as a case study. The main objective of this research is to contribute to the academic debate around the theme of the single rate of VAT versus differentiated rates, through the achievement of a series of analyses and statistical tests to revenues and percentages of GDP that they correspond, in the three scenarios considered in the study: differentiated rates, single rate of 17% and single rate of 21%.In the empirical part, hypotheses were developed, the effects on tax revenue of a differential collection system were analyzed and compared to a possible single rate regime on consumption to verify which one would be more efficient. data comparison permits to verify that the estimated revenue of the single rate of VAT is higher than the values ​​obtained by the system of differentiated rates, in any of the proposed models (17% or 21%). The results of this research are valid for all countries that adopt VAT or general tax transactions.

Robinson in the book ""Why Nations Fail"" with the case of the deep regional disparities in the economic performances observed within the ""Western"" European Union during the period 2001-2015. By adopting an approach to growth analysis based on binary response models, this paper quantifies the extent to which the quality of government institutions has shaped regional economic performances in the European Union throughout the period comprising the Great Recession. Empirical results show that: 1) The higher is the quality of institutions, the higher is the probability that a region with high income per capita will grow above the levels of the European Union as a whole. 2) The higher is the quality of institutions, the lower is the probability that a low-income region will grow below the levels of European Union as a whole. 3) The higher is the quality of institutions, the higher (lower) is the probability that any region, regardless of its income per capita, will outperform (underperform) the European Union as a whole. 4) The higher is the quality of Institutions, the lower is the probability that a region will ""fail"" to grow."
